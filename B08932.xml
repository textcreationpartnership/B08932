            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Truth brought to Light, OR, <hi>The Laſt WORDS of a DYING-MAN:</hi> Being <hi>The</hi> SPEECH <hi>of</hi> William Dillon <hi>Eſquire, Executed the twenty fifth of</hi> February, 1662. <hi>for the Death of</hi> J. Web, <hi>lately killed in a Fray in</hi> Long-Acre.</head>
            <p>GOod People, I ſtand here a Spectacle to God, Angels and Men, ſad and deplorable (I believe) to you, but in my inward Reflections on my Regenerate Eſtate, in my dear and bleſſed Saviour Jeſus, full of Spiritual Hopes and Comfort.</p>
            <p>I declare my ſelf to you all a true and conſtant Chriſtian, an Apoſtolical <hi>Romane Catholick,</hi> and on that account, I am parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly obliged to proteſt that my hopes are totally and ſolely pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Al-ſufficient Merits of my glorious Redeemer, from whoſe Merits, the Merits of Man receive their total ſupernatural condignity and worth. To help the compleating of the Sufferings of his own Body, in his myſtical, I am come here to participate of his beloved Croſſe, ſanctified and dignified by his own moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood.</p>
            <p>I give thanks to thoſe deſerving and charitable Perſons, who deſired and endeavoured my longer Life, for my better Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and amendment. But although they have failed in their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Interceſſions for me, there is an <hi>Advocate with the Father, even Jeſus Chriſt the Juſt,</hi> whoſe Power is infinite, to ſave to the uttermoſt.</p>
            <p>As I infold my ſelf in the Arms of his rich and embracing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo I would be joyned with you all in his Divine, as I am in my own derived charity.</p>
            <p>I wiſh you all good, as I ſhould have done that very perſon, if known to me, for whoſe Death I am condemned. God Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent knoweth my Innocency in that particular, being in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſo clear and free from that guilt, that to my knowledge I never touched the Man. May they have the benefit of the blood of Chriſt, who have occaſioned the loſſe of mine; and God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me in His, as I do them for my own.</p>
